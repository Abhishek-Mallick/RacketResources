## Ways To Contribute

- If an algorithm doesn't exist in the repository, you can implement it in Racket and open a pull request
- If there is a non-duplicate project you would like to add, you can open a pull request
- If there is a project you would like to modify, you can open a pull request
- If there is an algorithm you would like to see added, you can add that as an issue to the repository

## Ways NOT To Contribute
- Add code files not implemented in Racket
- Add code files that are spammy or invalid to the repository guidelines

## How To Contribute

1. Create a pull request with the files you'd like to add to the repository
2. Make sure to create a folder if the topic is not listed in the repository
3. Create a pull request modifying some file in the repository
4. Add an issue for a file you'd like to add or would like to see added

## Contribution Guidelines

1. All files must racket files (have a `.rkt` ending)
2. All programs must be implemented as functions: `(define ...)`
3. (Optional) Files can have a header specifying the purpose of the program
4. (Optional) Files can have examples for how they should be run
